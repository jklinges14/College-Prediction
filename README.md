# College-Prediction
Project- Overview
Many have tried, many have failed. Few trailblazers are ambitious enought to chase acceptance into the top 15 universites of the United States. Known for their grueling admissions process and heartbreaking decisions, the top 15 are at the pinnacle of every student's dream. In this project, we will be attempting to predict college acceptance for undergraduate students into top 15 national universities. The universities covered in this project will be strictly colleges from the United States.

Top 15 universites

In order to determine the top 15 universities in the United States, we will use the 2020 rankings published by U.S News.

Project Outline
Web Scraper-Programmed web scraper to gather data. Used python along with the beautifulsoup and requests modules
Machine Learning- Created a jupyter notebook where I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and machine learning to create a classifier model that predicts college acceptance. Utilized pandas, numpy, sklearn and xgboost.
Deployment- Created a web application, with the classifier model, using flask. Created a graphical user interface using CSS and HTML.
